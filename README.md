# Diabetes Risk Prediction

This project predicts the probability of diabetes using clinical and lifestyle data.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- LightGBM
- XGBoost

## Feature Engineering
- Cholesterol ratios
- BMI-age interactions
- Blood pressure indicators

## Evaluation
- Metric: ROC-AUC
- Best CV AUC: ~0.70

## What I Learned
- Feature engineering matters more than models
- LightGBM handles tabular data very well
- Over-tuning gives diminishing returns

## Next Steps
- Better validation
- Feature selection
- Model ensembling
